<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/made%20with-python-blue.svg" alt="made with python">


- This project was developed by my Team and I, as an entry to the Program Elective: Python A's Learning Activity.

- This game is a simple Text based Rpg format that was named as **SOLO LEVELING**
- It involves the *Main Character/Player* descending into a **monster infested Dungeon** to fight off monsters and gain experience and coins along the way!
- It has a shop, inventory, fight mechanics, Save and Load game features etc

Still under development.
